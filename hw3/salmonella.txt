From my sequence, I got genes that control:
needle length control protein [Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium]
antigen presentation protein SpaN [Salmonella enterica]>gb|ESF69790.1
Invasion protein InvJ [Salmonella enterica] >gb|EHC53263.1|Invasion protein InvJ
and more similarily. They all are genes found in Salmonella enterica
